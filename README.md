This project aims to design and implement a database for the Norwegian railway system. The database will serve as a centralized repository for managing various aspects of the railway network, including stations, trains, routes, schedules, and personnel. The goal is to create a robust and scalable database that can handle the complexities of railway operations while ensuring data integrity and accessibility. The task is described in the problem_description_railway.pdf. The project is from the spring of 2023 in the course Data Modelling, Databases, and Database Management Systems.
